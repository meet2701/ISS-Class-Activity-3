# ISS-Class-Activity-3

This project is a 3D scene created using A-FrameJS.  
I replaced the original shapes (box, sphere, cylinder) with octahedron, cone, and torus-knot.  
Also, I repositioned them to make the scene look more spacious.  
The ground plane was extended, and the background sky is kept as given.  
Open `2024101122.html` in browser to view the scene.  
Deployed on GitHub Pages as required.
